* Better Ajax Error Handling
** Better Messages / Presentation
** Better Error Recovery

* Setup Snap Handler tests

* Fix chrome tab crashes
* Give error 400 rather than 500 when cell address outside world is passed

* Revamp patterns definitions so we don't have write out coordinates
** Load patterns from file?  Parse in JS?

* Load test / optimize server

* Investigate refactoring canvas display to use 1 "thread" to paint and 1 "thread" to query server
** "thread" = series of calls to same function using setTimeout (see _repaintWorld)
