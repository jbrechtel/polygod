-- MUST HAVE FOR R1 --
* Better Ajax Error Handling
** Better Messages / Presentation
** Better Error Recovery

* Revamp resurrect / smite toolbar

* Fix chrome tab crashes

* Give error 400 rather than 500 when cell address outside world is passed
** Pereferrably without adding overhead of checking every cell address before... catching exception is probably better

* Load test / optimize server
** Evaluate CPU impact of reaping stale users on every request

* Investigate refactoring canvas display to use 1 "thread" to paint and 1 "thread" to query server
** "thread" = series of calls to same function using setTimeout (see _repaintWorld)

-- OTHER IDEAS (EITHER R1 OR AFTER) --

* Pimp Stats Section
** Requests / Second (current, max)
** ms / request (rendering time only, not waiting for new world)
** Memory Usage (just max? Current may be misleading if GHC doesn't release heap after peaks)

* Access to a larger world that user sees only a part of at any given time?
** impact on shared json rendering between concurrent requests

* Multiple colors of cells based on user?

* Revamp patterns definitions so we don't have write out coordinates
** Load patterns from file?  Parse in JS?
